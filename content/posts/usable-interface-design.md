# Usable Interface Design

## Intro

Design can be optimized for many things. When I want to use something, for me
the most important thing is that I can make it work. Something that I want to
use can be the best thing in the world but that is meaningless if I am not able
to actually use it. For example headphones, I believe Apple makes wonderful
sounding headphones as the sound on *Macbook*s is the best in the market. Sound
quality is just something you would expect Apple to do well.

The fact that Apple has headphones with a beautiful sounding sound just
won’t help if you are not able to listen with them.

## Context

Here is a very real and not made up situation. My baby and my wife are
sleeping. I finally have some time for myself. I just got the access to watch
"House of the Dragon" and now have the time to do so. If I want to watch the
series in a somewhat comfortable physical position I need to do it with
headphones. As life dictates I am left only with my wife's Apple headphones
(More specifically _AirPods_).

## How hard can it be

What starts to be the headphones is inside an aftermarket case. Intuitively I open the leathery
looking case and am greeted by a nice and accented “click”. I see the white box
with very round corners. I know it is the box that holds what I
understand are the actual headphones. I open the box and take out both
headphones. Now I don’t know what needs to be done at all. I do know that I
somehow need to connect them to my _Macbook_. Both products are from the same
company. How hard can it be?

I remember seeing an advertisement once. The Apple headphones are held near an
_iPhone_ which magically links both devices. How cool is that? I take the actual
headphones and want to rub them on my _Macbook_. But before I finish this action,
I begin to think - Irae, you are a software developer, this is silly, it won’t
work. I put the headphones on the table and begin to think. So many
possibilities. It for sure knows if the case is open or closed. I am pretty
certain it knows if the actual headphones are inside the case or not.

At this point I accept that help is needed. After pressing _Command-Space_ on my
_Macbook_ I start to type “Headphones”. No luck, it did suggest to me Wikipedia
and a Google search. What I was hoping for is a step by step wizard. But after
some googling a very comprehensive YouTube video is found. It turns out there
is actually a button on the thing. It’s just that the leather case was hiding
it. I take the white boxy thing out of the case and press the button. A very
small orange light goes on and after some seconds off. The first small
success. But orange? Orange is not a good color and I was hoping for a white
light. The confusion sets in again. I press the button once more, holding it for a
short period of time, a long period of time. Nothing. No light.

At this point it becomes almost personal. I assume the thing does not have any
charge. But for sure the headphones still have battery. Because I know that my
wife uses her headphones all the time and therefore must keep them charged as
she is - as I know - very organized. Maybe the headphones do still have battery but
the box does not have any charge left. I do know from the advertising I saw that
the box charges the headphones. Does this also work the other way around?

My philosophical thoughts won’t help, I most probably need to charge the thing.
After examining the white smooth box with its bold rounded corners I find a
hole. It looks like something could be plugged in it. A small success. I
understand that I plug connectors into things to charge them. I also know that
there is wireless charging. But I really don’t know much about wireless
charging and am therefore happy to have what seems to be just a normal way to
charge something. The hole has the form of an ellipsis. What is the only
charger with the form of an ellipsis? USB-C. Most silently and on my toes I
enter the room where my baby is sleeping and grab the charger for my new
_Macbook Air M1_ - which happens to be an USB-C charger. In my head slogans pass by
where I proudly recapitulate: _USB-C is the new thing that all devices will
use. It’s one power cable that can be used to charge everything. Neat_.
The surprise sets in when the USB-C charger does not fit the hole. It is very
close, the hole is really just a little too small.

At this point I know I need the other charger. The Apple charger, which is the
one that works for my _iPhone_. Unfortunately I can’t find it. I put it
somewhere and it’s not there. After some searching and looking around there is
not much else to do then to accept defeat. On the table there are now four
distinct parts of something that are
supposed to be headphones. Better pack it, else I could easily lose something.

# Conclusion

The conclusion? I am sure Apple headphones are a great product. The white box
looks very futuristic and lean. The case could hardly look more precious. I
don’t think it’s real leather but the gold font and the gold carabiner are a
nice accent. The headphones snap very nicely into the case with the help of
magnets. All in all a very decent looking product. Because it’s from Apple I am
sure it works very well and sounds very nice. What a fool am I who cannot use
it.
