# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy will explain how we use the personal data we collect from
you when you use our website.

## What data do we collect?

Counter collects the following data

-   Your username
-   An encrypted password
-   Domains which where used to access web pages containing your personalized
    tracking script.
-   Your browser's time zone, a preference that can be changed in the account
    settings.

Your personalized tracking script aggregates the following statistical information of your users.

-   The day of the week (As in: *Monday*, *Tuesday*, ...)
-   Your users device (As in *Phone*, *Tablet* or *Computer*)
-   The date of the visit
-   From which other website a visit originated.
-   The users browser (As in: *Firefox*, *Chrome*, *Microsoft Edge*, ...)
-   The hour compontent of the current time in a day
-   A country mapped to the users IP address.
-   The users operating system (As in: *Windows* or *Mac*)
-   Information on the users screen size
-   The users preferred language
-   Pages visited

These data points are saved anonymously in our primary database aggregated on a hourly, daily,
weekly, monthly, yearly and overall basis. Counter deletes hourly, daily,
weekly and monthly statistics after a certain time period. You can e.g. access
data from this month, but not data from last month. We try to improve your
users privacy by "forgetting" their data as time passes. We do not keep single
data points on your users but only statistical, that is aggregated data.

As of the 19. Sept 2022 we introduced historical archives persisting daily data permamentally in a separate database. This daily data can be queried aggregated by a specific date range.
