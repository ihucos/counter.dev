# Integrating Counter.dev in Shopify

Integrating the Counter.dev tracking script in your Shopify store allows you to
track visitors and gain valuable insights into your store's performance. Follow
the steps below to integrate Counter.dev into your Shopify store:

1. Log in to your Shopify store and navigate to the Online Store > Themes
section.

2. Click on the Actions button for the theme you want to edit and select Edit
code.

3. In the theme editor, click on the theme.liquid file from the left-hand side
navigation menu to open it.

4. Find the closing `</head>` tag in the theme.liquid file.

5. Copy the Counter.dev tracking script provided in your Counter.dev account
and paste it just before the closing `</head>` tag.

6. Save the changes to the theme.liquid file.

7. Clear any caching plugins you may have installed on your Shopify store.

8. Verify that the tracking code has been properly installed by visiting your
store and opening the developer console (usually done by pressing F12). The
console should not display any errors and the network tab should show that the
Counter.dev script has been loaded.

9. Log in to your Counter.dev account and check the analytics dashboard to see
if your Shopify store is being tracked.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the Counter.dev tracking
script into your Shopify store and can now start tracking visitors and
