# Integrating Counter.dev in WordPress

Integrating the Counter.dev tracking script in your WordPress website allows
you to track visitors and gain valuable insights into your website's
performance. Follow the steps below to integrate Counter.dev into your
WordPress site:

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to Appearance > Editor.

2. Open the header.php file and find the closing `</head>` tag.

3. Copy the Counter.dev tracking script provided in your Counter.dev account
and paste it just before the closing `</head>` tag.

4. Save the changes to the header.php file.

5. Clear any caching plugins you may have installed on your WordPress site.

6. Verify that the tracking code has been properly installed by visiting your
website and opening the developer console (usually done by pressing F12). The
console should not display any errors and the network tab should show that the
Counter.dev script has been loaded.

7. Log in to your Counter.dev account and check the analytics dashboard to see
if your WordPress website is being tracked.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the Counter.dev tracking
script into your WordPress website and can now start tracking visitors and
analyzing data to improve your website's performance.
