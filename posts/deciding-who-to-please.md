# Clashing goals


Counter tries to reach many goals. Some are aligned, some seem mutually
exclusive at times. Part of maturing such a project is deciding priorities. As
an example: while it is sensible to respect end-user's choice of using
tracking blockers and not trying to circumvent such a tool, counter's users rely
on having the most accurate data possible.

Let's list the goals of this project, in no particular order.

### Data Privacy

I don't think there is much that can be written about data privacy that was not
already publicly discussed. Everybody agrees it is an important topic.
Pity that usually choosing privacy friendly solutions means using inferior
products. We claim to be the exception.


### Free

For whatever reason I have joy in giving away an essential tool needed
for web development. Maybe I sympathise with the archaic notion of the internet
being a playground with not many barriers. Ultimately I build a tool for
myself, having to enter credit card details in my own software in order to use
it would be a turn off (Well, yes, I could hack it).

### Sustainability

It would be trivial to make a better time range selection for counter. But due to counter's
unique way of doing things - that is mostly keeping all data in memory - I
wouldn't be able to keep the lights on for much time if the project grows too
much. There are many
startups who failed to deliver on promises. I hope that counters way of
achieving hosting many users for relatively little money is transparently
enough disclosed.


### Open Source

Technically an Open Source project is nothing more than a project where the
Source Code is under a license generally accepted as Open Source (Counter is
*AGPL*-Licensed). But the general expectation goes beyond that: Good
documentation, configurability, deployment-independent code and
data-independent code are traits which require work. Work that could be easily
invested in adding in features instead.

### Being a business

A business works different than an Open Source project.

### Small CO2 footprint

Currently counter hosts hundreds of users and already
tracked many millions of visits all in a small Virtual Private Server. A
different analytics solution would need more resources in order to achieve the
same.

### Serving users

In the end it's like with a rucola salad. When asked in front
of friends, I'd say that I eat that. There are many good reasons to eat such a
healthy salad. But given the choice in a restaurant, believe me that I would
never order a rucola salad. The same goes for counter, being an Open Source
project and respecting the end-users data privacy is nice. But ultimately it is
about presenting insightful and comprehensive metrics to users in an appealing
way.



## What to pick?

So many good choices, which one to pick, which on to toss
overboard. In this blog post I want to proclaim caring about mostly one thing:
Users. Of course in a sustainable way. The only reason such a product can exist
is to serve and be usable to its users.
